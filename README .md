## Week 5: Scene Classification with Transfer Learning

**Goal:** Classify natural scenes (`buildings`, `forest`, `glacier`, `mountain`, `sea`, `street`) with a two-stage transfer learning pipeline.

**Dataset:** [Intel Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification). 11,929 train / 2,105 validation / 3,000 test images.

**Approach**
1. **Feature extraction:** backbone frozen, new `nn.Linear(512, 6)` head, Adam at 1e-3, 3 epochs. Only 3,078 trainable parameters (0.03%).
2. **Fine-tuning:** `layer4` and `fc` unfrozen (~8.4M parameters) with differential learning rates: 1e-4 for `layer4`, 1e-3 for `fc`. 3 epochs.
3. **Test evaluation:** run once on all 3,000 test images.

| Phase | Trainable Params | Val Loss | Val Acc | Test Acc |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Feature Extraction | 3,078 (0.03%) | 0.289 | 91.2% | - |
| Fine-Tuning (Layer 4) | ~8.4M (75.1%) | 0.218 | 94.4% | **94.1%** |

**Findings**
- Strongest classes: `forest` (F1 0.98) and `buildings` (F1 0.94).
- Weakest classes by recall: `glacier` (88.6%) and `mountain` (89.3%).
- The main confusion is glacier vs. mountain, since snowy ridges and icy slopes appear in both classes.

**Output:** model weights saved to `/kaggle/working/resnet18_intel.pt` (~44.7 MB).

## Week 6: Pediatric Pneumonia Detection in Chest Radiography

**Goal:** Build a ResNet-18 triage-support model for pediatric pneumonia, with a focus on data leakage, class imbalance, clinical thresholds and shortcut learning.

**Dataset:** [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). 5,840 radiographs from Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center (CC BY 4.0).

**Approach**

| Stage | What was done |
| :--- | :--- |
| Data audit | Imbalance 2.9:1 (1,341 Normal / 3,875 Pneumonia). 62 exact duplicates, all within-split. 0 near-duplicates between train and test. |
| Leakage control | `StratifiedGroupKFold(n_splits=6)` grouped by patient ID, with 0 shared patient groups between train and validation. |
| Imbalance | Inverse-frequency weighted cross-entropy: Normal = 1.935, Pneumonia = 0.674. |
| Augmentation | `RandomResizedCrop`, `RandomRotation(10)` and `ColorJitter`. Horizontal and vertical flips deliberately excluded because chest anatomy is asymmetric. |
| Training | Phase 1 trains the head only (1,026 parameters). Phase 2 unfreezes `layer4` with differential learning rates. Checkpoints selected by validation macro-F1. |
| Thresholding | Threshold lowered from 0.50 to **0.366**, chosen on validation to reach recall of at least 0.95. |
| Interpretability | Grad-CAM on `layer4` over 3 correct and 3 incorrect test cases. |

**Results (test set, evaluated once)**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Accuracy | 92.5% |
| Macro-F1 | 0.917 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.979 |
| Sensitivity at t = 0.366 | 99.0% (386 / 390) |
| Specificity at t = 0.366 | 80.3% (188 / 234) |
| PPV at test prevalence (62.5%) | 89.4% |
| PPV at screening prevalence (5%) | 20.9% |

Fine-tuning improved validation macro-F1 from 0.881 to 0.945 (+0.064).

**Key takeaways**
- **Shortcut learning confirmed:** Grad-CAM showed false positives driven by non-lung features such as the radiopaque **'R' marker**, shoulder soft tissue and humerus edges. Suggested fix: lung-field segmentation masking before classification.
- **Base-rate falloff:** at 5% prevalence, about 4 in 5 positive flags are false alarms despite 99% sensitivity.
- **Limitations:** single-center pediatric cohort (ages 1-5), not validated on adults, bedside AP units or other pathologies. Decision-support only, **not for autonomous clinical use**.
